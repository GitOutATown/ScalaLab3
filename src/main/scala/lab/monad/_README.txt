THIS DIR IS ALL FROM ONE TUT

DO NOT MIX WITH OTHER CODE!!!

TODO: FINISH THE SECOND PART:

It's been an interesting and educational exercise to work through translating these examples from Haskell to Scala. I've gotten a bit more comfortable with Haskell syntax, which should help me out in the future. But having programmed in Scala for over 2 years, I'm already pretty comfortable calling methods like map, flatMap, and collect on an Option. So I'm looking forward to translating the other monad examples in the Haskell wikibook. But before we do that, we'll have to work through two more Maybe examples presented in the next section, which also introduces the <=< operator, which chains functions that return monads.

Also: Note that I have initially studied the code in this tut per the blog snippets here in ScalaLab3,
but I have cloned that whole tut into its own project (and should study it directly as well):
