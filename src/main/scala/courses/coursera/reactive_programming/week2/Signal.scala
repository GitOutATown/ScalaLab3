 * by a new object version which in this case contains the expression which
 * causes, or drives the change.
 * 
 * Hmmm... I'm starting to build a broader picture of this apperatus. I think
 * the sequence goes like this: Var.apply constructs a new instance of class
 * Var, which in turn calls super.update(expr). In true functional practice
 * The expresion remains integrally linked with the resulting (consequential)
 * value it produces. super.update then calls computeValue, which involves
 * caller.withValue (DynamicVariable) using the passed expression to compute 
 * the value--but there is some necessary thread magic, which I don't quite 
 * understand the purpose of yet (but I'd like to! And I will!) to compute 
 * the value, which is then further applied in a general propagation on all 
 * registered observers (and their observers) (cascading broadcasted recursion).
