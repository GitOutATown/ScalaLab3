   * references is the set of existing known pairs of cell names and their expressions. It is similar to namedExpressions.
   * computeValues will return an immutable Map. How you construct that is up to you but the easiest way is probably to map a function over the namedExpressions -- a function that accepts a key/value pair as input and produces a key/value as output. Hint: that function will somehow eval the expression that is the value of that key/value pair.

   * It took me sometime to figure how to solve it, think about how far you can simplify an expression once you encounter a reference (which can subsequently have nested references deep down) to it's base condition (kind of denormalization for the lack of better word) and introduce interim checks, anything more i'd say i'd be pretty much ed up giving out the solution.
   *
   * https://class.coursera.org/reactive-002/forum/thread?thread_id=211
   * To anon above - think about the Map that you're passing around.  What happens when something is missing from the Map?
   *
   * https://class.coursera.org/reactive-002/forum/thread?thread_id=211
   * Look carefully at getReferenceExpr. It gets passed a name for which you want to get the expr.
   * Why does it need to be passed a List of references? What does it do with the list. Why does each method get passed its own List of references/namedExpressions. 
   * 
   * https://class.coursera.org/reactive-002/forum/thread?thread_id=329  
   * It was indeed '2+3' instead of '2 + 3' the error
